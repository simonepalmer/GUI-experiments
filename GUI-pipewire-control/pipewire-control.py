        # 1st: If pipewire changes the order of their settings or in other ways change the format
        # of the output the settings_list[-4] could be something completely different, however, this
        # new way should be safer to not break since it's looking for the name of the settings it
        # wants the value for and then taking that index + 2 (+1 would be 'value:') 
        # Full line reads -: update: id:0 key:'clock.rate' value:'48000' type:'' :- so split at "'"
        # seems the best way to get the number by itself.
        #
        # I guess that if I would want to do it even more safe I could split at ":" and find the 
        # index after the matched index, then take that string and loop though it to remove every
        # character that is not a digit. So, safer but it I think it's a little bit convoluted
        # so I don't know if I like the trade off

        # 2nd: Pipewire has a "default" and a 'forced' settings of these values. To make it always
        # show the correct current setting it needs to check if the forced value is '0', which it 
        # will be after a reboot, and then take the default value when opening the program instead.
